AS There is at least one business object, where the reference              
   characteristic values cannot be retrieved by the OBJECT_CHECK function  
   module because of system failure. The details can be found in the full  
   log of the conversion report (RNGC_CONV_REF_CHAR), where the IDs of the 
   business objects are indicated with warning messages.

AS The reference characteristic values of these business objects cannot be
