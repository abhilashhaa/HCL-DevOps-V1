AS There is at least one business object which has reference               
   characteristics with values that cannot be converted. The details can be
=   found in the full log of the conversion report (RNGC_CONV_REF_CHAR),   
   where the IDs of the business objects are indicated with warning        
   messages.

AS The reference characteristic value(s) of these business object(s) cannot
   be copied to table AUSP, therefore they are skipped.

AS If the reference characteristic values of these business objects are not
   necessary to be copied to AUSP, then there is no action required.       
   Otherwise, the type conversion error(s) should be examined (hint: check 
   the actual type of the reference characteristic and the actual type of  
   the referred field in the referred table: they should match). Fix not   
   matching characteristic types and then run the conversion again.
