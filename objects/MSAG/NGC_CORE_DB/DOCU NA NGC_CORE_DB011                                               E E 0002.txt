AS Database inconsistency: There is at least one klart-obtab-objek which   
   has more than one CUOBJ in table INOB. The details can be found in the  
   full log of the conversion report (RNGC_XPRA_04_CLF_HDR), where the     
   affected CUOBJs are indicated with warning messages.

AS In these cases the first CUOBJs are used in table CLF_HDR.              
U1 &WHAT_TO_DO&                                                            
AS The database inconsistency can be eliminated by merging all CUOBJs into 
   the first. This means that all other CUOBJs for the klart-obtab-objek   
   should be replaced everywhere(KSSK, AUSP, etc) by the first one(which is
   now contained in CLF_HDR), and these other CUOBJs should be erased from 
   INOB then.
