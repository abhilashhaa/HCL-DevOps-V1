AS There is at least one business object which is foreign locked. The      
   details can be found in the full log of the conversion report           
   (RNGC_CONV_REF_CHAR), where the IDs of the locked business objects are  
   indicated with warning messages.

AS The reference characteristic values of these business objects cannot be 
   copied to table AUSP, therefore they are skipped.

AS If the reference characteristic values of these business objects are not
   necessary to be copied to AUSP, then there is no action required.       
   Otherwise, unlock the business objects (other applications are locking  
   them at the moment) and run the conversion again.
