AS The OBJECT_CHECK function module for business object type &V1& is not   
   implemented.

AS No reference characteristic values can be retrieved for any business    
   object instance of this type (&V1&), and therefore can not be copied to 
   table AUSP.

AS Currently, the reference characteristic values of this business object  
   type (&V1&) are not copied to table AUSP.                               
/  If this is not necessary to copy there, then no action is required.     
AS Otherwise:                                                              
AS If this business object type (&V1&) is a customer defined one, then the 
   customer should implement the function module, and run the conversion   
   again.                                                                  
AS If this business object type (&V1&) is an SAP defined one, then the SAP 
   support should be contacted.                                            
AS The actual name of the OBJECT_CHECK function module is determined by the
   function module named CLOCH_FUNCTION_NAME, by specifying the OBTAB as   
   input parameter (usually it is like this: OBJECT_CHECK_MARA).
