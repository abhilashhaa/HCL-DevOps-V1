AS Database inconsistency: There is at least one business object which is  
   not found. The details can be found in the full log of the conversion   
   report (RNGC_CONV_REF_CHAR), where the IDs of the non-existent business 
   objects are indicated with warning messages.

AS The reference characteristic values of these business objects can not be
   copied to table AUSP, therefore they are skipped.

AS The database inconsistency can be eliminated by two ways:               
AS ·,,Create the business object (which does not exist currently) with the 
   exact same object ID and object type (if the classification UI is       
   triggered during creating, the conversion does not need to be run       
   again).                                                                 
AS Or:                                                                     
AS ·,,Erase the database entries referring to this non-existent business   
   object from tables INOB and/or KSSK and/or AUSP. In this case the       
   conversion does not need to be run again.                               
AS Be aware, that if the used class type is a multobj=true class type, then
   KSSK.OBJEK and AUSP.OBJEK are the internal object IDs matching in table 
   INOB.CUOBJ (the true object ID is INOB.OBJEK in this case). If it is a  
   multobj=false class type, then KSSK.OBJEK and AUSP.OBJEK are the true   
   object IDs.
