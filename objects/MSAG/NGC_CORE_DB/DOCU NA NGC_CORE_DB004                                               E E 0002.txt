AS There is at least one business object where an error message is raised  
   in the OBJECT_CHECK function module. The details can be found in the    
   full log of the conversion report (RNGC_CONV_REF_CHAR), where the IDs of
   the business objects are indicated with warning messages, along with the
   raised error message showed as a warning message as well.

AS The reference characteristic values of these business objects cannot be 
   copied to table AUSP, therefore they are skipped.

AS If the reference characteristic values of these business objects are not
   necessary to be copied to AUSP, then there is no action required.       
   Otherwise, the raised error message(s) have to be examined and the      
   actual issue have to be fixed and then you should run the conversion    
   again.
