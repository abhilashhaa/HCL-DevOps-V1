AS The following data conversion is performed by this XPRA:                
AS Every entry in the INOB table for which there is no corresponding KSSK  
   entry (where INOB-CUOBJ = KSSK-OBJEK), is considered an inconsistent    
   INOB entry which should not remain in the database table. These INOB    
   entries are deleted by the XRPA report.
