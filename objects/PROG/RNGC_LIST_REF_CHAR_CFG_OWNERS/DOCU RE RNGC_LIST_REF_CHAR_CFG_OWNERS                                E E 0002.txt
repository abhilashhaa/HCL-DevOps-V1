U1 &PURPOSE&                                                               
AS In the Customizing settings for Classification, node and leaf objects   
   can be defined with regards to a class type. In case of a leaf object   
   (for example, a material variant of a configurable material), the       
   redundant storage of the reference characteristic values of the         
   corresponding node object (for example, the configurable material)      
   results in the restriction of the allowed value set of the leaf object  
   to the value defined in the node object.                                
AS For example, you classify a material using a configurable class type    
   (300) and you do a restriction to just one single allowed value for one 
   characteristic. If the material is now used in configuration, it will   
   cause this value to be set automatically. The value cannot be changed   
   and cannot be deleted by the user. This is the standard behavior.       
AS With the redundant storage<(>,<)> this kind of restriction now happens  
   automatically for all object characteristics with a reference to the    
   MARA or MAKT database table and assigned to the class used.             
AS This report shows a list of the configuration owners for reference      
   characteristic values referring to the MARA or MAKT database table.
