U1 Function                                                                
*  This BAPI creates a classification with assigned values if the          
   classification does not yet exist. The classification is defined by the 
   required fields object key (ObjectKeyNew), object table                 
   (ObjectTableNew), class name (AllocDetail-Class_Num), and class type    
   (AllocDetail-Class_Type). The characteristics and their values are      
   transferred in different tables according to type. Numeric, time, and   
   date characteristics are transferred in table AllocValuesNum. Character 
   and boolean characteristics are transferred in table AllocValuesChar,   
   and currency characteristics are transferred in table AllocValuesCurr.  
*  If the BAPI runs successfully, table RETURN contains no messages of     
   type 'E'.                                                               
U1 Note                                                                    
*  The object key (ObjectKey) must be transferred in internal format,      
   before conversion exits. For example, a material number must be         
   transferred with leading zeros.                                         
U1 Caution                                                                 
*  This BAPI does not change the database. To change the database, call    
   BAPI BapiService.TransactionCommit afterwards.                          
*  This BAPI can only be used with objects that are not classes.           
*  The values processed in this BAPI only affect classification, not       
   configuration.
