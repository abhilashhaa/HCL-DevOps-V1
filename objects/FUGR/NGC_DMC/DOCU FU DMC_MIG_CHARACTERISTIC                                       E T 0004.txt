AS This BAPI creates a characteristic that does not yet exist.             
AS The following fields must contain data:                                 
B1 Charact_Name (characteristic name)                                      
B1 Data_Type (data type)                                                   
B1 Length (number of characters)                                           
B1 Decimals (number of decimal places)                                     
B1 Status (status) in structure <ZH>CharactDetail</>                       
B1 Description (description) in structure <ZH>CharactDescription</>        
B1 Either Language_Int (internal language format, 1 character) or          
   Language_ISO (external language format, 2 characters)                   
AL ISO format overrides internal format. If there is more than one entry   
   for the same language, the last is relevant.                            
B1 The values must be entered in the following values tables, according to 
   data type: numeric, time, and date values in <ZH>CharactValuesNum       
=  </>, character and boolean values in <ZH>CharactValuesChar</>, and      
   currency values in <ZH>CharactValuesCurr</>. The value descriptions are 
   in table <ZH>CharactValuesDescr</>, regardless of data type.            
AS Check tables are entered in table <ZH>CharactReferences</> and          
   restrictions to class types are in table <ZH>CharactRestrictions</>.    
AS If the BAPI runs successfully, table RETURN contains no messages of type
   'E'.

   BAPI <ZH>BapiService.TransactionCommit</> afterwards.
