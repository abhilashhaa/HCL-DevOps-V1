  METHOD access_modify.

* You are reminded that mode modify is the same as insert, with one important difference:

* Mode INSERT is intended for newly created objects, for which a TADIR entry does not yet
* exist. In that case, the system shows a pop-up for the entry of the package, which isn't
* desirable when the SAPGUI is not available.

* In the context of abapGit, the package is known.
