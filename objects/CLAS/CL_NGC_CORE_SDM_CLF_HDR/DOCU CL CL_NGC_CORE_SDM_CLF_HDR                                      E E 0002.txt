U1 &FUNCTIONALITY&                                                         
*  The following data conversion is performed by this SDM:                 
*  The OBJEKP field is filled in all already existing entries in the table 
   CLF_HDR (in case of single object class type it will be OBJEK, in case  
   of multi object class type it will be CUOBJ), and new CLF_HDR entries   
   are created for all KSSK/INOB entries which do not yet have one (OBJEKP 
   is filled with the same logic).
